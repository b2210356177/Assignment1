Hi, my name is Beyza Uğur. I'm 23 years old. Computer Science is my second department.
I have bachelor degree in Psychological Counseling and Guidance at Hacettepe University.
I choose Computer Science for second bachelor degree because it was my childhood dream.
I want to write about my interests. I like walking by myself, I can play electric guitar
and I like skateboarding. I'm kind of person like who following her dreams.
I like to challenge myself. But that's okay because I'm making effort to chase my dream and
it's make me feel good.


I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website;
I will not share my work(not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for 
what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions 
or conserns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the 
instructors within their office hours.
